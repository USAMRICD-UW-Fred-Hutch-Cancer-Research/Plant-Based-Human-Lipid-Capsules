VirusTC Clinical Overview: Sterile Biomedical & Blood Products
==============================================================

### **Leading the Industry in Plant-Based Sterile Biologicals**

VirusTC is at the forefront of the medical industry, pioneering the production of sterile biomedical products and organic blood substitutes. Our mission is grounded in the fundamental scientific principle of the conservation of mass: matter cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change form.

Every component of human blood---and human biology itself---originates from the external environment. Specifically, the nutrients, minerals, and lipids that comprise our blood, plasma, and tissues are derived from plants or from animals that consume plants. Every day, the human body naturally processes this plant matter, transmuting it into the biological fluids and structures necessary for life.

VirusTC industrializes this natural biological process. We scientifically process plant matter into sterile, compatible human lipids to support patients with physiological deficiencies, ensuring they receive the essential building blocks for survival and recovery.

### **Flagship Product: Lípidos (Organic Plant-Based Sterile CSF)**

**Lípidos** is an FDA-approved, plant-based medical clinical formula designed for use with a catheter pump. It acts as a direct support system for survivors with damaged prostates, particularly those undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.

#### **Mechanism of Action & Clinical Indications**

-   **Prostatic Function Replacement:** The prostate functions as a pump for lipids, delivering them into internal organs via the spine to become bodily fluids. When this gland is damaged or compromised by pathology, the body loses its ability to generate these essential "vessels of life".

-   **Systemic Fluid Restoration:** Lípidos replaces the lipid capsules and spinal fluid vitamins lost due to prostate cancer. These lipid capsules are versatile, forming the basis of:

    -   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** Capsules that fill the spine and reach the brain.

    -   **Blood Products:** Lipid capsules filled with Iron form red blood cells (hemoglobins), while those filled with Zinc form white blood cells (plasma).

    -   **Other Fluids:** Semen and breast milk precursors.

-   **Sterile Support:** The formula provides alkaline antiviral medication to maintain a clean, healthy spinal column, brain cavity, and internal organ tract.

#### **Nutritional & Mineral Composition**

Lípidos is engineered to deliver strong, sterile lipid capsules containing a precise balance of minerals and vitamins essential for homeostasis.

| **Minerals** | **Vitamins** |
| --- | --- |
| Sodium (Na), Calcium (Ca) | Thiamine ($B_1$), Riboflavin ($B_2$) |
| Potassium (K), Magnesium (Mg) | Niacin ($B_3$), Pantothenic acid ($B_5$) |
| Phosphorus (P), Selenium (Se) | Pyridoxine ($B_6$), Folic acid ($B_9$) |
| Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe) | Ascorbic acid (C) |
| Manganese (Mn), Chromium (Cr), Zinc (Zn) | Phyllochinon (K) |
